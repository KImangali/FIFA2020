# FIFA 2020
In my project I am analyzing a fifa2020 simulator game

For the analysis, I used the following data: overall reiting of players, age of players, nationalities of players, club, value and wage of players, preffered foot(right-handed or left-handed), international reputation of players, position in team

The dataset is taken from the webpage of Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset?select=players_20.csv
